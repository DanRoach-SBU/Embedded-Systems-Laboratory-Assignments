# Embedded-Systems-Laboratory-Assignments

This repository was made to display laboratory assignments from the following courses:

ESE 280: Embedded Systems Design I

ESE 382: Embedded Systems Design II

Assignments from ESE 280 are programmed in AVR Assembly, and assignments from ESE 382 are programmed in C. I've uploaded the last laboratory assignment from ESE 280, as it was certainly the largest and most complex of the assignments we were given. Likewise, I will post the last assignment of ESE 382 following the completion of the course.
